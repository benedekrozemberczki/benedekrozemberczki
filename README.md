- 
- 
- Currently working on machine learning for temporal and dynamic graph structured data.
- Iâ€™m searching for people who would love to collaborate on [PyTorch Geometric Temporal](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal).
- Ask me about fancypants graph mining problems.
